Performance antipattern is a formalization of a bad design practice that induces performance degradations, and it consists of conditions for its detection along with ==refactorings== for its removal.

==PADRE== (Performance Antipattern Detection and Refactoring) a tool for detection and removal of performance antipattern in UML models. The tool:
- Suggests possible architectural refactoring that might show better performance than the current system architecture.
- Can be adopted in production by exploiting traceability links between a running system and its corresponding model, then it when a possible beneficial evolution is identified, the refactoring should be semi-automatically.

More approaches for detecting and removing performance problems in software models:
- Koziolek et al. Multi-objetive evolutionary optimization algorithm searching optimal trade-offs in the design space, in the context of Palladio Component Models (PCMs). 
	- Limitation: Time-consuming
	- PADRE: Does not look por optimality but to satisfy performance requirements.
- Wert et al. Introduced heuristics for measurement-based detection of five well-known performance antipatterns in inter-component communications.
- Parsons et al. Limited on EJB performance antipatterns, he failed.

### PADRE Tool
- Supports UML models profiled with MARTE
- Performance analysis consists of the resolution of an analytic performance model, generated by MARTE, by means of Mean-Value Analysis.

### Workflow
- Initial model which must satisfy all the tool requirements.
- Model-to-text (XMI format) transformation (UML-MARTE to JMVA)
- Performance analysis that provides indices which are propagated back to the system model
- Performance Analysis Results Back-Annotation debe extraer, procesar y reportar adecuadamente los indices de rendimiento del .jmva file to the initial model 
- Performance Antipatterns Detection
- PADRE ground on a specific .evl file containing:
	- The antipattern detection rules that comes from their occurrence conditions
	- Refactorings aimed at removing detected antipatterns from the model
- Refactored and optimized model

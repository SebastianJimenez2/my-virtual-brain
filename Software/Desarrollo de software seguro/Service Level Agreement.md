A service level agreement (SLA) is ==a documented contract between a customer and a service provider that defines the level of service to be provided, and the metrics used to measure it==. SLAs can vary by industry, vendor, and type of service, but typically include the following components: 
- **Service levels**: The quality, speed, and quantity of work to be provided     
- **Penalties**: What happens if agreed-upon service levels aren't met 
- **Cancellation conditions**: How the agreement can be canceled 
- **Plan for unmet goals**: What will happen if goals aren't met
- **Stakeholders**: A list of all stakeholders and their goals 
- **Services excluded**: A list of services that aren't included in the agreement 

SLAs are important for managing customer expectations and the relationship between the service provider and customer. They can also help improve customer satisfaction and agent productivity by clearly defining expectations and timelines. 

Related to SLAs are service-level objectives (SLOs), which are key components of an SLA that measure the performance of the service provider's application. An operational level agreement (OLA) is an internal contract that outlines how the service provider plans to fulfill the SLA.
